I am writing this project with the main goal to learn more about the awesome [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux)!

After watching the amazing egghead series [Getting started with Redux](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux)
by [@dan_abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) I got crazy to start writing some stuff with redux!

And there you go.

(writing this project for study only propuses)

*IN DEVELOPMENT*
